## Background Information
- Job information is only logged when the job either completes or is removed (see field `JobStatus`). Idle, running, or held jobs are not logged by design.
- Jobs removed during the scheduling phase (**ExitCode** `3`) often have unreliable or nonsensical field values, depending on their state at removal.
- Time-related fields are accurate to 1-second intervals. While milliseconds are reported in some cases, the actual precision is limited to one second.

## Outstanding Questions
1. The GlideinEntryName column is mostly empty, except for occasional entries like `FNAL_GPGrid_ce03_mcore_op`. When these appear, they also show up in the Arguments column as `-entry FNAL_GPGrid_ce03_mcore_op`. Could you clarify the significance of this field?
2. Similarly, the `MATCH_EXP_JOB_GLIDEIN_Entry_Name` column often has unknown values but occasionally includes entries like `Fermilab_UK_RAL_arc-ce-test02`. How should I interpret this column, and does it indicate anything about the nature of the job?
3. Is there a specific column or set of attributes that indicates whether a job is a pilot job? If so, how do pilot jobs differ in their logging compared to other jobs?
4. It's unclear on how `DAG_Node_Name` and `DAGManJobId` relate to the DAGMan workflow for these HEP jobs. Could you provide some guidance on how these fields tie into the overall workflow?

| **RequestCpus**               | Indicates the number of CPUs requested for each job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Numeric |
| **RequestDisk**               | Denotes the disk space requested (in KiB) for each job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Numeric |
| **RequestSlots**              | Represents the number of slots requested for a job. One slot equals 2GB of memory and 1 CPU core. This value scales automatically based on the requested memory and CPU. For example, in High Energy Physics (HEP) workflows, jobs requesting 8GB of memory and 1 CPU will be assigned 4 slots.                               | Numeric |
| **MemoryProvisioned**         | The amount of memory (in MB) allocated to the job. Though the number of slots scales with the CPU/memory request (see `RequestSlots`), this number does not necessarily reflect the amount of memory corresponding to the requested slots. Instead, it follows the `RequestMemory` field.                                     | Numeric |
| **CpusProvisioned**           | The number of CPUs provisioned for the job. Though the number of slots scales with the CPU/memory request (see `RequestSlots`), this number does not necessarily reflect 1 CPU for each requested slot. Instead, it follows the `RequestCpus` field.                                                                          | Numeric |
| **JOB_EXPECTED_MAX_LIFETIME** | Indicates the expected maximum runtime (in seconds) of the job. By default, this is 8 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Numeric |
| **JobStatus**                 | Enumerates the status of the job. Possible values are {`1`: Idle, `2`: Running, `3`: Removed, `4`: Completed, `5`: Held}. Typically, only jobs with statuses `3` (removed) or `4` (completed) are logged. Note that a completed job is not necessarily successful; the **ExitCode** field should be checked for confirmation. | Numeric |
| **ExitCode**                  | Reports the exit code returned by the job executable. A value of `0` indicates success, while any non-zero value signifies failure. All completed jobs (**JobStatus** `4`) should have an **ExitCode**, although it might not always be `0`.                                                                                  | Numeric |
| **MemoryUsage**               | Reflects the amount of memory used by the job. It is unclear if this represents peak or average usage. This value is only available for completed jobs.                                                                                                                                                                       | Numeric |
| **RequestMemoryEfficiency**   | Reports the ratio of **MemoryUsage** to **RequestMemory**, offering insight into how effectively the allocated memory was utilized.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Numeric |
| **User**                      | Specifies the username of the individual who submitted the job. This is formatted as an email address (e.g., `<user>@fnal.gov`) and corresponds to the **Owner** field.                                                                                                                                                       | String  |
| **Owner**                     | Identifies the owner of the job submission. This field is synonymous with the **User** but is used in different contexts for tracking and auditing.                                                                                                                                                                           | String  |
| **AccountingGroup**           | Indicates the parent accounting group of the submitter, typically formatted as `<group_X>.Y.<user>`. Here, `X` denotes the group, `Y` is an optional subgroup, and `<user>` matches the **User** field.                                                                                                                       | String  |
| **TotalSubmitProcs**          | Denotes the total number of processes/jobs submitted. This can range from individual job submissions to large-scale batch submissions.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Numeric |
| **ProcId**                    | Uniquely identifies the job within a submission, ranging from `0` to **TotalSubmitProcs**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Numeric |
| **ClusterId**                 | Serves as the cluster ID of the job submission. Combined with **ProcId**, this field uniquely identifies a job. This combination ensures no two jobs have conflicting identifiers, aiding in precise job tracking.                                                                                                            | Numeric |
| **JobCurrentWaitTime**        | Measures the time (in seconds) the job spent in the scheduler queue before being matched to a grid slot. High wait times can indicate resource contention, while low wait times reflect efficient scheduling.                                                                                                                 | Numeric |
