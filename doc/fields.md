## Background Information
- Job information is only logged when the job either completes or is removed (see field `JobStatus`). Idle, running, or held jobs are not logged by design.
- Jobs removed during the scheduling phase (**ExitCode** `3`) often have unreliable or nonsensical field values, depending on their state at removal.
- Time-related fields are accurate to 1-second intervals. While milliseconds are reported in some cases, the actual precision is limited to one second.

## Outstanding Questions
1. The GlideinEntryName column is mostly empty, except for occasional entries like `FNAL_GPGrid_ce03_mcore_op`. When these appear, they also show up in the Arguments column as `-entry FNAL_GPGrid_ce03_mcore_op`. Could you clarify the significance of this field?
2. Similarly, the `MATCH_EXP_JOB_GLIDEIN_Entry_Name` column often has unknown values but occasionally includes entries like `Fermilab_UK_RAL_arc-ce-test02`. How should I interpret this column, and does it indicate anything about the nature of the job?
3. Is there a specific column or set of attributes that indicates whether a job is a pilot job? If so, how do pilot jobs differ in their logging compared to other jobs?
4. It's unclear on how `DAG_Node_Name` and `DAGManJobId` relate to the DAGMan workflow for these HEP jobs. Could you provide some guidance on how these fields tie into the overall workflow?

Typically, only jobs with statuses `3` (removed) or `4` (completed) are logged. Note that a completed job is not necessarily successful; the **ExitCode** field should be checked for confirmation. | Numeric |
| **ExitCode**                  | Reports the exit code returned by the job executable. A value of `0` indicates success, while any non-zero value signifies failure. All completed jobs (**JobStatus** `4`) should have an **ExitCode**, although it might not always be `0`.                                                                                  | Numeric |

| **Owner**                     | Identifies the owner of the job submission. This field is synonymous with the **User** but is used in different contexts for tracking and auditing.                                                                                                                                                                           | String  |
